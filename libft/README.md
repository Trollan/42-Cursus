# libft - Malaga 42

libft is a project within the Malaga 42 program, which involves the implementation of a library of useful functions in the C programming language. The objective of this project is to recreate some standard library functions and create additional ones that can be used in future projects.

## üìö Functions

The libft library contains various functions that can be used in C programs. Some of the functions implemented include:

- Memory manipulation functions, such as `memset`, `memcpy`, `memmove`, etc.
- String manipulation functions, such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strncpy`, etc.
- Conversion functions, such as `atoi`, `itoa`, `toupper`, `tolower`, etc.
- Linked list functions, such as `lstnew`, `lstadd_front`, `lstsize`, etc.
- And many more!

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

To use the libft library, you will need to have the following installed:

- Unix/Linux operating system.
- GCC compiler.

## üöÄ Installation Instructions

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/malaga42/libft.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd libft
```
Compile the library using the Makefile:
```make```
This will generate a library file called "libft.a".

## üí° Usage Instructions

Once you have compiled the library, you can use it in your C programs by including the header file and linking the library.

To include the header file in your program, add the following line at the beginning:
```
#include "libft.h"
```
